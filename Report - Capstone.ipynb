To understand a place and it surrounding we need to create clusters of that particular area and check which cluster contains minimum number places and what is the feasible thing that can be build around in every neighborhood in every cluster.

    "A business can grow and develop when there are not much of competitions and when the product produced is of great quality. In any particular area there can be a lot of people with same business and products. Suppose in Brooklyn, if there are 5 gyms in the neighborhood there is no point in building one more gym. Rather a shop for gym equipments such as - weights, repairing of machines, protein products, gym wear can be opened which can help people as well as gym owners to buy products from the same. I am going to cluster the places around Booklyn and identify what business can be opened in every cluster."

Along with the json file I will use Foursquare api to collect data about the neighborhood within newyork regarding various places. After collecting data, it will be cleaned with only required fields for understanding the neighborhood. Then I will focus on Brooklyn and understand it surrounding. Various apis' and packages will be required for extraction, cleaning and working on data."

Then in Brooklyn all the neighborhood is identified and visualized. Later Brooklyn data is given to K mean for clustering with a cluster of 5. It creates 5 clusters and identifies the cluster with maximum number of businesses. We can visualize and see what can be opened in any cluster."
